    "description": "\nThis product is a classroom tool that scaffolds higher order thinking. Its a collaborative strategy that using building bricks to help structure students ideas. Learners build knowledge structures with information (attached to different coloured bricks). Students desks are turned into workshops where they physically manipulate information into meaningful creations. They show sequences of information (like stories), rank information by importance and pretty much all other essential cognitive skills you need at school. The end result is clarity in thought and better collaborative conversations. I want this to be marketed as a sophisticated knowledge tool applicable to all ages and subjects. It gives students the cognitive edge, they get a little more 'RAM'!.\n\nI want to continue with the construction/building theme as well as the mind/brain/learning theme. They need to be blended somehow. Teachers find it easier to talk about building/scaffolding analogies as its less abstract.\n      ",
